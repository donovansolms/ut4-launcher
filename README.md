# Unreal Tournament 4 Launcher for Linux

An Unreal Tournament 4 launcher and incremental updater for Linux

## Features

1. Download and install the latest build of UT4
2. Run any of your installed UT4 versions
3. Incremental updates - only downloads and installs the files that changed (no need to download the entire game at every patch release)
4. (Kinda) Nice looking web-based interface
5. **No** dependencies (as long as you have a browser installed)
6. TODO: Complete list

## Why

Currently no launcher exists for Unreal Tournament 4 on Linux. If a new version is released
you need to download the full game (around 10GB+). This launcher aims to solve that by only
downloading and updating the files that changed between your installed version and the latest
version.
